One area of particular complexity is exchange fees . Crypto traders have an array of options to choose from when trading, but many exchanges hide fee structures in the fine print and confuse users with overlapping fee structures and discounts. The good news is we built this site to make it easy for you to track your fees across multiple exchanges. Types of crypto exchange fees \uf0c1 Cryptocurrency exchanges charge fees on different types of user behavior: Trading Fees \u200a\u2014\u200athe primary source of revenue for exchanges. They are typically charged on both fiat-crypto trades as well as crypto-crypto trades. Deposit/Withdrawal Fees\u200a \u2014some exchanges charge fees for deposits and/or withdrawals. Deposit fees vary based on the type of deposit but are less common than withdrawal fees since exchanges want to incentivize users to fund their account. For cryptocurrency withdrawals, many exchanges limit fees to any blockchain transaction costs (usually a flat fee regardless of the amount withdrawn), but some will take an additional fee based on your country or the type of withdrawal (crypto vs fiat) Interest/Borrowing/Liquidation Fees\u200a \u2014some exchanges like Bybit, Kraken, Poloniex, and MEXC offer crypto margin trading: the ability to borrow or synthetically borrow additional funds to increase your position and create leverage . These exchanges typically charge additional fees based on the amount borrowed on margin and an interest rate determined by the supply of funds available. Additionally, if your trade goes upside down and the position is liquidated you may be charged an additional fee. Discounts \uf0c1 Market Makers & Volume Discounts \u200a\u2014\u200amany exchanges offer lower trading fees to \u201cmarket makers\u201d, traders placing limit orders instead of market orders , and high volume traders to incentivize exchange liquidity Exchange Token Discounts\u200a \u2014\u200aan increasingly popular approach is to discount exchange fees for users who purchase an exchange\u2019s own cryptocurrency token. Several non-US exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and Bibox have adopted this system to help incentivize investment into their tokens. These exchanges have elected to decrease the amount of the discount each year until phasing it out entirely in after four to five years Let\u2019s take a closer look at fees across some of the top crypto exchanges.
